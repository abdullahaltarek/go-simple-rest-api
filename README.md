# Go Simple CRUD REST API

Simple Go REST API for CRUD operations

No database is used, just in memory data structures. No 3rd party library was used.
This was the main motto for this project, fully implemented using Go standard libraries

Routes:
/people
/people/get/{id}
/people/create/{id}
/people/update/{id}
/people/delete/{id}

Also, a logger is implemented for logging incoming requests onto the console
